Having Python 3 on your NAO will require installing [the python3nao package](https://cloud.aldebaran-robotics.com/application/python3nao/), which contains Python 3 as well as libraries such as `qi` and `numpy`.

Once installed, the Python 3 executable is at `/home/nao/.local/share/PackageManager/apps/python3nao/bin/runpy3.sh` (see notes below on why it's like this)

As this can be a bit cumbersome, here is an example project:
* https://github.com/EmileKroeger/mini_python3_nao_app

You can also use [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to generate new projects from this template:
* https://github.com/EmileKroeger/cookiecutter_naoapp

(this will be more convenient than going around changing the Application name and ID in various places in the project)

# More API details.

You can find the API reference [in the official documentation](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/naoqi/index.html) (examples given are for Python 2)

# FAQ

## Can I also use it on my computer

Sure, you can do this without any extra package; just `pip3 install qi` might work (depending of your environment), and if it doesn't, rebuild [libqi-python](https://github.com/aldebaran/libqi-python) from source as explained there.

## Why runpy3.sh ?

On NAO, the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is set to include a folder containing the Python 2.7 version of the qi library; so if you just directly use the `python3` in the package and do `import qi`, it will find the Python 2.7 library first and fail.

## Isn't Python 3 already installed on the system?

Yes, there is actually already a Python 3.5 installed on NAO, but it does not include `qi` or `naoqi` libraries and so cannot be used for controlling the robot.

## Why doesn't ALProxy work?

That's part of the deprecated `naoqi` library that is not in the package; use the `qi` library instead.
