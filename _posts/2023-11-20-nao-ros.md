NAO and Pepper can work with ROS 1 and ROS 2. The core projects can be found on the [ros-naoqi](https://github.com/ros-naoqi) github organisation.

# Ros 2

It's possible to run a ROS node from a computer that connects to NAO, with this:

https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver2

This allows running a local node (on your computer) that can connect to NAO.

For installation, simply follow the README.

# Ros 1

For a general introduction (with a lot of pointers, but not fully up-to-date): [RosWiki::NAO](https://wiki.ros.org/nao).
